🧠 Coding Guidelines

Folder & File Naming

Use camelCase for folders

Use PascalCase for files and components

Use kebab-case for CSS class names


React Style

Keep components simple and focused

Group logic clearly

Comment code where it's not obvious


CSS Rules

Each module should have its own CSS file

Avoid inline styles

Use shared variables if needed (we’ll add a central CSS file later)



---

🌿 Git Guidelines

Always work in a new branch:

feature/ubakaFix-form

bug/fix-navbar


Push often and write meaningful commits:

git commit -m "Add form UI for UbakaFix"

Open Pull Requests with a description of what you did

Tag @agnes in the PR for review

✨ Best Practices

Don't be afraid to ask questions!

Use shared components when possible

Keep things clean and readable

Push unfinished work if you're stuck—someone can help!
